Trip Exchange – The Comingling of Demand-Responsive Services

Enhancing Coordination Among Service Providers

Public and nonprofit demand-response service providers have long sought the ability to coordinate their operations to facilitate the seamless assignment of customer trips across different services. This capability aims to increase the number of trips provided while simultaneously lowering costs.

However, realizing this vision has proven difficult, not due to federal prohibitions, but rather due to the complex regulatory environment surrounding funding programs. Service providers often rely on designated funding to sustain their operations and ensure that clients receive the transportation services they need.

Current Service Sharing Practices

While some sharing of services occurs among different programs, it is typically managed at the local government level when a regional authority has jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the outcomes of these efforts tend to be modest at best.

Case Study: FlexDanmark

A notable example outside the United States is FlexDanmark, which offers a demand-responsive service throughout Denmark. This program was established through significant institutional effort and federal support. Key features include:

• Centralized Booking: All trip requests are managed through a central office.

• Standardized Specifications: Participating service providers must adhere to specific transaction protocols and technology requirements.

• Automated Trip Assignment: The central office schedules and assigns trip requests to eligible service providers through an automated system.

While FlexDanmark serves as an effective model, it does not embody the ideal of a fully cooperative trip exchange.

Key Elements for a Successful Trip Exchange

1. Central Government Mandate and Funding: A strong governmental backing is essential to establish a standardized system that benefits all suppliers and clients.

2. Standardized Transaction Specifications and Technology: A uniform framework enables various service providers to operate on a level playing field, facilitating peer-to-peer trip exchanges.

3. Peer-to-Peer Trip Exchange Framework: The proposed Trip Exchange would enable different service providers to easily exchange trip requests among one another, maximizing resources and efficient service delivery.
