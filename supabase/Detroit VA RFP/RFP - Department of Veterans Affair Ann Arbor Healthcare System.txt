This information shall also be available to the Contracting Officer and /or COR during the IDIQ period and shall be provided within 3 business days of the Contractor’s receipt of the request.  
	•	VA reserves the right to restrict any Contractor employee from performing services as a driver or attendant under this IDIQ who does not meet the required qualifications for the services they are required to perform, who violates Federal regulations, or who is identified as a potential threat to the security, safety, health and/or operational mission of the VA and its’ veteran population.

	•	DRIVER TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

	•	All contracted personnel working on this contract must complete TMS 20939 Privacy training on an annual basis.
	•	The Contractor shall maintain a file demonstrating satisfactory evidence of above training, and evidence that the instructor is qualified to teach the above.

	•	START-UP REQUIREMENTS
	•	Contractor shall be fully staffed, fully equipped, and ready to perform in full compliance with all IDIQ requirements within 30 days of IDIQ award.  The contractor shall submit within 5 days of IDIQ award specific information on vehicles and drivers.  
	•	PATIENT PICK-UP REQUIREMENTS–SCHEDULED TRIPS
	•	Most patients requiring transportation will reside in the Greater Detroit Metropolitan Area.  The addresses of patients will vary daily.  The list of patients will be faxed to the Contractor by 4:30 p.m., on the day before pick-up by the authorized individuals in the travel department at the VAMC Detroit.  The Contractor shall call the veteran by telephone prior to pick up to confirm the veteran's availability.  If the contractor is unable to confirm the veteran's availability for pick up, driver shall not go to the veteran’s home and no charges will be billed to the VA.  Also, if the Veteran confirms availability over the phone, but then refuses transportation after the contractor has arrived at the Veteran’s residence, the contractor shall immediately notify VA's Travel Unit.  Providing that the driver and vehicle are in compliance with all IDIQ requirements, this situation will be considered a “dry run” due to patient refusal.   The contractor shall bill for a verified "dry run" at the applicable rate specified in the schedule.  The contractor shall clearly identify any and all billing for “dry runs” on the invoice.  When either wheelchair, scooter, or ambulatory patient transportation service under the terms of this IDIQ are required, but due to unforeseen circumstances outside the control of the contractor the patient is not available for pick-up, the Contractor will be paid the applicable rate specified in the schedule. 
	•	Contractor/Drivers shall follow the below instructions:
	•	Contractor shall call the next patient/passenger before departing from their current location.
	•	If the patient/care giver/spouse/family member/etc. answers, the Contractor shall confirm the patient’s name and address. The Contractor shall also provide them with the estimated time of arrival (ETA).
	•	If the patient/care giver/spouse/family member/etc. does not answer and is connected to an answering machine or voicemail: 
	•	the Contractor shall leave a message for the patient to contact the VA Travel Office, AND
	•	The Contractor/driver shall immediately call their Dispatcher and inform them of the situation, AND
	•	The Contractor/ Dispatcher shall contact the VA Travel Office/AOD for further instructions.
	•	If the patient/passenger declines a ride or requests something other than what is detailed on the pick-up list:
	•	Contractor/Driver shall immediately call their Dispatcher and inform them of the situation. The Dispatcher shall contact the VA Travel Office/AOD for further instructions
	•	Contractor/Dispatcher:
	•	Contractor/dispatcher shall, upon receiving the details of a potential “Dry Run” from a driver, contact the VA Travel Office/AOD and follow instructions below:
	•	Between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., call the Travel Office at:  313-576-4307
	•	If there is no answer, make another call.  If no answer, please do the following:
	•	Call Ken Hill at (313) 576-1000 extension 63633.  If no answer do the following:
	•	To page Mr. Hill, dial (313) 576-1000 extension 61135 - this will bring you to the paging system – Input 63633.
	•	If Mr. Hill is non-responsive, call Eleanor Shaw at (313) 576-1000 extension 61318.  If no answer do the following:
	•	To page Mr. Matanzas, dial (313) 576-1000 extension 65393 - this will bring you to the paging system – Input 65393.
	•	Between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., call the AOD at: 313-576-4351
	•	If there is no answer, call again.  
	•	Once the Contractor’s Dispatcher has received a determination of whether or not they should proceed, the Contractor’s Dispatcher shall immediately call their driver to let them know what action they should take.
	•	Service Animals
	•	Drivers shall permit and accommodate the patient’s service animal on each trip.  The ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) defines a service animal as any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. If they meet this definition, animals are considered service animals under the ADA regardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government.
	•	Service animals perform some of the functions and tasks that the individual with a disability cannot perform for him or herself. Guide dogs are one type of service animal, used by some individuals who are blind. This is the type of service animal with which most people are familiar. But there are service animals that assist persons with other kinds of disabilities in their day-to-day activities. Some examples include:
	•	Alerting persons with hearing impairments to sounds. 
	•	Pulling wheelchairs or carrying and picking up things for persons with mobility impairments. 
	•	Assisting persons with mobility impairments with balance. 
	•	A service animal is not a pet.
	•	Some, but not all, service animals wear special collars and harnesses. Some, but not all, are licensed or certified and have identification papers. If drivers are not certain that an animal is a service animal, they may ask the patient if it is a service animal required because of a disability. However, a patient may not be carrying documentation of his or her medical condition or disability. Therefore, such documentation generally may not be required as a condition for providing transportation to a patient accompanied by a service animal. Although a number of states have programs to certify service animals, drivers shall not insist on proof of state certification before permitting the service animal to accompany the patient.  (see http://www.ada.gov/qasrvc.htm)
	•	RETURN TRIPS
	•	Many of the patients that are transported to an appointment will need transportation from the Medical Center or Clinic back to their residence after their appointment.  Each return transportation trip will be ordered by the Travel Clerk or Administrative Officer of the Day as a one way trip.  Although return trips will be ordered the day the transportation is needed, the schedule of patients sent to the contractor will give the contractor a rough approximation of the return trips that may be necessary the following day.  When the patient is being picked up from the VAMC Detroit and/or the Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) located in Pontiac and Yale, Michigan, or other regional VA Medical Centers, the Contractor shall pick up the patient within 30 minutes of a call from the Travel Clerk or the Administrative Officer of the Day.
	•	The Contractor shall use the following procedure during normal business hours:
	•	Only passenger/patients who have “checked in” with the Contractor’s on-site coordinator after their appointment will be scheduled for a return ride. 
	•	Any passenger/patients who check in but are not available or not in the designated waiting area at the time of departure, will be a “Dry Run”.  A travel ticket will be created indicating a No Show/Dry Run.
	•	If the patient does not check in, the trip is considered a cancellation.
	•	The Contractor shall use the following procedure after normal business hours:

Contractor shall not transport VA patients with other non-VA customers of the Contractor.  The Contractor shall allow an alert or sightseeing dog to accompany a Veteran as needed. 
	•	WAIT TIME
	•	When time is lost at either end or both ends of a trip due to circumstances beyond the Contractor’s control, the Contractor may request reimbursement for waiting time.  If the pickup is other than at the VA Medical Center, the Contractor shall call the Travel Clerk on duty as soon as they anticipate a delay may develop for which the Contractor expects to claim reimbursement.  This call is for the purpose of verifying the Contractor’s arrival time at the pickup point and to alert the VA Travel Office of a delay in the patient boarding the vehicle.  The VA Travel Clerk will call the veteran to verify the potential delay prior to authorizing wait time.  This call is not necessary if the Contractor anticipates no delay for which they shall claim reimbursement.  
	•	When waiting time is verified and authorized, the government will reimburse the Contractor at the applicable rate specified in the schedule, for each quarter hour after the 15 minute waiting period included in the base rate.  Waiting time can include time spent waiting both on and off VA premises and either at pick up or drop off when authorized by appropriate VAMC personnel.
	•	All waiting time charges shall be authorized and supported by:
	•	Notification to the Travel Clerk that the driver (vehicle) is in a waiting status.  At this point, information concerning reason for wait shall be provided, AND

The delivery and departure area for all patients will be specified by the Travel Clerk at the time the order is placed for services.  The driver shall have the travel voucher time and date stamped by the Travel Clerk when picking up a patient for transportation from the VA and when dropping off or delivering a patient at the VA.  The driver shall turn in the travel voucher to the travel office when dropping off the patient at the VA.
	•	When a driver arrives at the Detroit VAMC to transport a patient, the Travel Clerk for the Administrative Officer will contact the inpatient or outpatient area to determine if the patient is ready.  Driver shall be required to assist patients to and from the vehicle as necessary. All travel vouchers shall be filled out on the day of service and shall be signed by authorized VA personnel. During normal work hours the travel clerk will be the individual authorized to sign the travel voucher.  For, afterhours, weekends and holidays, the Administrative Officer of the Day (AOD), in admitting, will be the individual authorized to sign travel voucher. If, during non-administrative hours, the AOD is not in the admitting area, a special place will be identified for the Contractor’s drivers to leave the vouchers for signature.
	•	The Contractor shall deliver wheelchair patients as well as those who need to be escorted (such as those who are demented, Alzheimer's or similar) to the yellow section, Travel room C1822 of the JDDVAMC for checking in and shall have their travel vouchers signed.  The vouchers shall be signed by the Travel Clerk or the AOD for add-ons, scheduled patients and for no-shows / dry runs.   The Contractor shall inform the travel section of ambulatory patients that have arrived and have vouchers signed.  Vouchers shall be submitted timely and will be signed off as expeditiously as possible.  Travel section will ensure vouchers match patient pickups and drop offs.  If there are any discrepancies they will be handled as expeditiously as possible.  During non-administrative hours and when the AOD is not in the admitting area, a special place will be identified for the contractor's drivers to leave the vouchers for signature.  This will eliminate the Contractor waiting until the next business day to obtain a signature or the driver waiting for the return of the AOD.
	•	When wheelchair, scooter or ambulatory transportation service under this BPA involves the pick-up of a patient scheduled to arrive by air, train or bus and the driver finds such patient does not arrive on schedule, the driver shall contact the Travel Clerk and inquire as to the status of the arrival.  If appropriate, waiting time may be authorized for the time spent in waiting in accordance with the applicable rate in the schedule.  If the Contractor reported as scheduled and no patient is transported, the Contractor will be reimbursed at the dry run rate.  It is very rare that there is a dry run to an airport, train station or to the bus station.

B.3 PRICE/COST SCHEDULE
The guaranteed minimum only applies to the Federal Government Fiscal Year in which the contract is awarded. The guaranteed minimum is $15,000.00.  The Government does not guarantee, nor is it obligated, to place any orders under this contract in excess of the guaranteed minimum.  The maximum total value of the contract, inclusive of all option periods exercised, shall not exceed $7,400,000.00. Individual task orders will be funded annually. The Contracting Officer is the only authorized individual that can place annual task orders against this contract for the estimated amount of services for the specific timeframe, and the task orders shall be issued to the contractor.

B.4 REVIEW REQUIRED REGISTRATION WITH CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM (CPARS)
As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $250,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials.  The FAR requires that the contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing.  To fulfill this requirement VA uses an online database, CPARS, which is maintained by the Naval Seal Logistics Center in Portsmouth, Virginia.  CPARS has connectivity with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies. PPIRS is the system used to collect and retrieve performance assessment reports used in source selection determinations and completed CPARS report cards transferred to PPIRS.  CPARS also includes access to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (FAPIIS).  FAPIIS is a web-enabled application accessed via CPARS for contractor responsibility determination information.
Each contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $250,000 is required to register with CPARS database at the following web address: www.cpars.csd.disa.mil.  Help in registering can be obtained by contacting Customer Support Desk @ DSN: 684-1690 or COMM: 207-438-1690. Registration should occur no later than thirty days after contract award, and must be kept current should there be any change to the contractor's registered representative.  
For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete.  For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the contractor's performance annually.  Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed.  The report shall be assigned in CPARS to the contractor's designated representative for comment.  The contractor representative will have sixty days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the VA contracting officer.  
Failure to have a current registration in the CPARS database, or to re-assign the report to the VA contracting officer within those sixty days, will result in the Government's evaluation being placed on file in the database with a statement that the contractor failed to respond.

  (c) Representation. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database are considered eligible to receive award of a resulting contract. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible and certified SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 13 CFR 121, 125, and 128, and VAAR subpart 819.70.
  (d) Agreement/LOS certification. When awarded a contract action, including orders under multipleaward contracts, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size, and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and part 125, including the non-manufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting (LOS) requirements in 13 CFR 121.406(b) and 13 CFR 125.6. For the purpose of limitations on subcontracting, only certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database (including independent contractors) shall be considered eligible and/or ‘‘similarly situated’’ (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to comply with the required LOS certification requirements in this solicitation (see 852.219–75 or 852.219–76 as applicable). These requirements are summarized as follows:
    (1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database (excluding direct costs to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and the SDVOSB/ VOSB does not provide the service, such as airline travel, cloud computing services, or mass media purchases). When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract.
    (2) Supplies/products.
      (i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a non-manufacturer of such supplies), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database. When a contract includes both supply and services, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the supply portion of the contract.
      (ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a non-manufacturer, the SDVOSB prime contractor will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver as described in 13 CFR 121.406(b)(5) has been granted. Refer to 13 CFR 125.6(a)(2)(ii) for guidance pertaining to multiple item procurements.
    (3) General construction. In the case of a contract for general construction, the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database.
    (4) Special trade construction contractors. In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, no more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, may be paid to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database.
    (5) Subcontracting. An SDVOSB subcontractor must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be certified and listed in the SBA certification database to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based. For information and more specific requirements, refer to 13 CFR 125.6.
  (e) Required limitations on subcontracting compliance measurement period. An SDVOSB shall comply with the limitations on subcontracting as follows:
[] By the end of the base term of the contract or order, and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or
[X] By the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract.
  (f) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered eligible as an SDVOSB if the joint venture complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 128.402 and the managing joint venture partner makes the representations under paragraph (c) of this clause. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants.
  (g) Precedence. The VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR 802.101, subpart 819.70, and this clause, takes precedence over any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA Veteran Small Business Certification Program and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program.
  (h) Misrepresentation. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), any business concern, including all its principals, that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company’s SDVOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years (see VAAR 809.406–2 Causes for Debarment).

    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
